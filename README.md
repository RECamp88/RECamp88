<center><h3>~About Me~ </h3></center>
<p>I have always been creative and have loved solving puzzles from a young age.  I have used both in my previous diverse roles, including over two decades of working with customers through technical support roles mostly in telecommunications companies.  I really believe to resolve an issue you have to be willing to look at the basics, see how every component works together, and then ask the correct questions. For me, these questions usually begin with, ‚ÄúWhat if‚Äù.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a Software Engineering focus from the University of Phoenix. I took a very scenic route to get there, but ultimately, it is my curiosity about what could be that sparked my interest in coding. Whether it is making music, jewelry, art, or programming, I want to keep expanding my knowledge to continue creating what some considered impossible.</p> 
<ul>
  <li>I enjoy camping and aspire to see all the National Forests in the United States.</li>
  <li>I make wire-wrapped jewelry and enjoy making ZenTangle art in my pass time.</li>
  <li>I have learned to love vegetable gardening and even started a Facebook group to share with others.</li>
  <li>I enjoy turning old items into new and useful things.</li>
</ul>
